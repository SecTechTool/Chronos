<p><!-- https://go.dev/issue/7181 -->
  When printing very deep stacks, the runtime now prints the first 50
  (innermost) frames followed by the bottom 50 (outermost) frames,
  rather than just printing the first 100 frames. This makes it easier
  to see how deeply recursive stacks started, and is especially
  valuable for debugging stack overflows.

      The new <a href="/pkg/sync/#OnceFunc"><code>OnceFunc</code></a>,
      <a href="/pkg/sync/#OnceValue"><code>OnceValue</code></a>, and
      <a href="/pkg/sync/#OnceValues"><code>OnceValues</code></a>
      functions capture a common use of <a href="/pkg/sync/#Once">Once</a> to
      lazily initialize a value on first use.
